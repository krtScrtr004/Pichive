- This is an unfinished work
- There maybe some features that would not word
- Feedbacks and error handling is displayed as alert messages for the meantime
- Some features (such as uploading an image, changing profile images, commenting on posts - since those are implemented as asynchronous tasks) may seem to be stucked (but is really not) since feedbacks are only implemented as alert messages
- API key for cloud image storage (https://imgbb.com/) is provided
- Other third-party libraries are also included in this ZIP file
